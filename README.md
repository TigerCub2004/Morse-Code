<pros>: This project was very helpful in that it was a compilation of all the course content so far. I felt it was a good review.

<cons>: I have no complaints for this project. I did have one problem with my code however. When the Tester class runs, after the system asks if the user wants to use the converter or not, and the user accepts, the first loop through the while for accepting a promt from the user is bypassed. Through some experimentation and analysis of my code, I was able to fix the issue.
